Just a small program to generate cards from
Redmine csv export. 
It provides a small help for the scrum board. :)

Using Qt4.

How to use:
For the moment only working with the following csv file:

#,Assignee,Tracker,Status,Subject,Target version,Estimated time,% Done,Description

In Redmine, choose "Current iteration", then export to CSV (bottom right).
Thick current selection and description.
Do not use "Quick export".
